## Project Description
TinderfyTM is a music-based dating application designed to match users based on the calculated similarity of their liked songs. Unlike traditional dating apps that rely primarily on visual preferences, Tinderfy emphasizes music taste as a key indicator of compatibility. Users select their favorite songs and complete their profiles. The application then processes these song choices to recommend users with similar musical interests, displaying a similarity score to aid in the decision-making process. If two users express interest in each other, a match is formed. Our target audience includes college students and adults who value music in their relationships. The application aims to provide an intuitive and accessible user experience, fostering connections through shared musical passions.
